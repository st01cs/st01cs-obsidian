**Andrew Ng** @AndrewYNg [2025-11-13](https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1989003741316673714)

I recently received an email titled “An 18-year-old’s dilemma: Too late to contribute to AI?” Its author, who gave me permission to share this, is preparing for college. He is worried that by the time he graduates, AI will be so good there’s no meaningful work left for him to do to contribute to humanity, and he will just live on Universal Basic Income (UBI). I wrote back to reassure him that there will still be plenty of work he can do for decades hence, and encouraged him to work hard and learn to build with AI. But this conversation struck me as an example of how harmful hype about AI is.  
我最近收到一封题为“一个 18 岁少年的困境：为 AI 贡献还为时已晚？”的邮件。写信人授权我分享这封邮件，他正在准备上大学。他担心等到毕业时，AI 技术会发展得如此之好，以至于没有对他有意义的工作可以做了，从而无法为人类做出贡献，他只能依靠全民基本收入（UBI）生活。我回复他，安慰他未来几十年里仍会有很多工作可以做，并鼓励他努力学习和用 AI 来创造。但这次对话让我意识到，关于 AI 的炒作有多么有害。  
  
Yes, AI is amazingly intelligent, and I’m thrilled to be using it every day to build things I couldn’t have built a year ago. At the same time, AI is still incredibly dumb, and I would not trust a frontier LLM by itself to prioritize my calendar, carry out resumé screening, or choose what to order for lunch — tasks that businesses routinely ask junior personnel to do.  
是的，AI 非常聪明，我每天使用它来构建我一年前无法完成的事情，对此我感到非常兴奋。但同时，AI 仍然非常愚蠢，我不会信任一个前沿的大语言模型（LLM）独自处理我的日程安排、简历筛选或选择午餐吃什么——这些都是企业通常让初级员工做的事情。  
  
Yes, we can build AI software to do these tasks. For example, after a lot of customization work, one of my teams now has a decent AI resumé screening assistant. But the point is it took a lot of customization.  
是的，我们可以构建 AI 软件来做这些任务。例如，经过大量的定制工作后，我的一支团队现在拥有一个相当不错的 AI 简历筛选助手。但重点是，这需要大量的定制工作。  
  
Even though LLMs can handle a much more general set of tasks than previous iterations of AI technology, compared to what humans can do, they are still highly specialized. They’re much better at working with text than other modalities, still require lots of custom engineering to get it the right context for a particular application, and we have few tools — and only inefficient ones — for getting our systems to learn from feedback and repeated exposure to a specific task (such as screening resumés for a particular role).  
尽管大语言模型比以往的人工智能技术能处理更广泛的任务，但与人类能做的事情相比，它们仍然高度专业化。它们在处理文本方面比其他模态好得多，但仍然需要大量的定制工程才能为特定应用提供正确的上下文，而且我们几乎没有工具——只有效率低下的工具——来让我们的系统从反馈和反复接触特定任务（例如为特定职位筛选简历）中学习。  
  
AI has stark limitations, and despite rapid improvements, it will remain limited compared to humans for a long time.  
人工智能有明显的局限性，尽管发展迅速，但与人类相比，它将长期保持局限性。  
  
AI is amazing, but it has unfortunately been hyped up to be even more amazing than it is. A pernicious aspect of hype is that it often contains an element of truth, but not to the degree of the hype. This makes it difficult for nontechnical people to discern where the truth really is. Modern AI is a general purpose technology that is enabling many applications, but AI that can do any intellectual tasks that a human can (a popular definition for AGI) is still decades away or longer. This nuanced message that AI is general, but not that general, often is lost in the noise of today's media environment.  
AI 非常令人惊叹，但不幸的是，它被过度炒作，甚至被吹得比实际更神奇。炒作的一个有害方面是它往往包含一些真实的成分，但程度远不及炒作的程度。这使得非技术人员难以辨别真相究竟在哪里。现代 AI 是一项通用技术，它正在支持许多应用，但能够完成人类任何智力任务的 AI（AGI 的一个流行定义）仍然还需要几十年甚至更长时间才能实现。这种 AI 是通用的，但并非万能的微妙信息，在当今的媒体环境中往往被噪音所淹没。  
  
Similarly, the progress of frontier models is amazing! But not so amazing that they’ll be able to do everything under the sun without a lot of customization. I know VC investors who are scared to invest in application-layer startups because they are worried that frontier AI model companies will quickly wipe out all of these businesses by improving their models. While some thin wrappers around LLMs no doubt will be replaced, there also remains a huge set of valuable applications that the current trajectory of progress of frontier models won’t displace for a long time.  
同样，前沿模型的进展也令人惊叹！但并非到了无所不能的程度，没有大量定制是无法完成所有事情的。我知道一些风险投资家害怕投资应用层初创公司，因为他们担心前沿 AI 模型公司会通过改进模型迅速淘汰所有这些业务。虽然围绕 LLMs 的一些薄外壳无疑会被取代，但仍然存在大量有价值的应用，前沿模型的当前发展轨迹在很长一段时间内都不会取代它们。  
  
Without accurate information about the current state of AI and how it is likely to progress, some young people will decide not to enter AI because think think AGI leaves them no meaningful role, or decide not to learn how to code because they fear AI will automate it — right when it is the best time ever to join our field.

Let us all keep working to get to a precise understanding of what’s actually possible, and keep building!  
缺乏对当前 AI 状态及其发展趋势的准确信息，一些年轻人可能会决定不进入 AI 领域，因为他们认为 AGI（通用人工智能）将使他们没有有意义的作用，或者决定不学习如何编程，因为他们担心 AI 会自动化编程——而此时正是加入我们这个领域的最佳时机。

让我们共同努力，以获得对实际可能性的精确理解，并继续建设！
