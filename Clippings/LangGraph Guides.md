## Guides

The pages in this section provide a conceptual overview and how-tos for the following topics:

## Agent development

- [Overview](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/overview/): Use prebuilt components to build an agent.
- [Run an agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/run_agents/): Run an agent by providing input, interpreting output, enabling streaming, and controlling execution limits.

## LangGraph APIs

- [Graph API](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/): Use the Graph API to define workflows using a graph paradigm.
- [Functional API](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/functional_api/): Use Functional API to build workflows using a functional paradigm without thinking about the graph structure.
- [Runtime](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/pregel/): Pregel implements LangGraph's runtime, managing the execution of LangGraph applications.

## Core capabilities

These capabilities are available in both LangGraph OSS and the LangGraph Platform.

- [Streaming](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming/): Stream outputs from a LangGraph graph.
- [Persistence](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/): Persist the state of a LangGraph graph.
- [Durable execution](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/durable_execution/): Save progress at key points in the graph execution.
- [Memory](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/): Remember information about previous interactions.
- [Context](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/context/): Pass outside data to a LangGraph graph to provide context for the graph execution.
- [Models](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/models/): Integrate various LLMs into your LangGraph application.
- [Tools](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/tools/): Interface directly with external systems.
- [Human-in-the-loop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/): Pause a graph and wait for human input at any point in a workflow.
- [Time travel](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/time-travel/): Travel back in time to a specific point in the execution of a LangGraph graph.
- [Subgraphs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/subgraphs/): Build modular graphs.
- [Multi-agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/): Break down a complex workflow into multiple agents.
- [MCP](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/mcp/): Use MCP servers in a LangGraph graph.
- [Evaluation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/evals/): Use LangSmith to evaluate your graph's performance.
