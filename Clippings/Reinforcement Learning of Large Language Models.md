### Prerequisites

Students are expected to have basic familiarity with deep learning at the level of image classification. No prior experience with reinforcement learning (RL) or large language models (LLMs) is assumed. For the deep RL lectures, students should be familiar with conditional expectations and the tower property (law of total expectation).
