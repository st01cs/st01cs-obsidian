• Kent Beck is one of the most influential figures in modern software development. Creator of Extreme Programming (XP), co-author of The Agile Manifesto, and a pioneer of Test-Driven Development (TDD), he’s shaped how teams write, test, and think about code.  
  
Now, with over five decades of programming experience, Kent is still pushing boundaries—this time with AI coding tools. In this episode of Pragmatic Engineer, I sit down with him to talk about what’s changed, what hasn’t, and why he’s more excited than ever to code.  
  
In our conversation, we cover:  
  
• Why Kent calls AI tools an “unpredictable genie”—and how he’s using them  
• Why Kent no longer has an emotional attachment to any specific programming language  
• The backstory of The Agile Manifesto—and why Kent resisted the word “agile”  
• An overview of XP (Extreme Programming) and how Grady Booch played a role in the name  
• Tape-to-tape experiments in Kent’s childhood that laid the groundwork for TDD  
• Kent’s time at Facebook and how he adapted to its culture and use of feature flags  
• And much more!
