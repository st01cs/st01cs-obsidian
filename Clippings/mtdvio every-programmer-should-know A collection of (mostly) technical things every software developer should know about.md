A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know.

☝️ *These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack*

Highly opinionated 💣. Not backed by science. Comes in no particular order ♻️

U like it? ⭐ it and [share](https://twitter.com/mr_mig_by/status/900735231552098306) with a friendly developer! U don't like it? [Watch the doggo](https://twitter.com/RespectfulMemes/status/900147758845308930) 🐶

*P.S. You [don't need to know](https://xkcd.com/1050/) all of that by heart to be a programmer. But knowing the stuff will help you become better! 💪*

*P.P.S. [Contributions](https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!*

### Platform Engineering

> A modern discipline that evolved from DevOps and SRE principles, focused on improving developer experience and productivity by building and managing self-service tools and workflows, often through an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). The goal is to reduce cognitive load on developers and streamline the path to production.

- **What is Platform Engineering?**
	- [Microsoft Learn: What is platform engineering?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/platform-engineering/what-is-platform-engineering)  
		A comprehensive overview of the practice, its goals, and core capabilities.
	- [Atlassian: What is Platform Engineering?](https://www.atlassian.com/developer-experience/platform-engineering)
