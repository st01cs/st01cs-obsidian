## Course Description

In the last few years, large language models have introduced a revolutionary new paradigm in software development. The traditional software development lifecycle is being transformed by AI automation at every stage, raising the question: how should the next generation of software engineers leverage these advances to 10x their productivity and prepare for their careers?

This course demonstrates that modern AI tooling will not only enhance developer productivity but also democratize software engineering for a broader audience. We'll show that software development has evolved from 0-1 code creation to an iterative workflow of plan, generate with AI, modify, and repeat. Students will master both the theory behind traditional software engineering challenges and the cutting-edge AI-powered tools solving them today.

Through hands-on engineering tasks and talks from industry pioneers building these revolutionary tools, you'll gain practical experience with AI-assisted development, automated testing, intelligent documentation, and security vulnerability detection. By the end of this course, you'll have a crisp understanding of how to integrate state-of-the-art LLM models into complex development workflows and avoid common pitfalls.

## Grading

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### What programming languages will we use in this course?

+

The course is language-agnostic and focuses on tools and practices that work across different programming languages. However, examples will primarily use Python, JavaScript, and some systems programming languages where appropriate. The emphasis is on understanding modern development practices rather than mastering specific languages.

#### Do I need prior experience with AI tools like GitHub Copilot?

+

No prior experience with AI development tools is required. The course will start with fundamentals and progressively build to more advanced usage. However, strong programming fundamentals (CS111 and above) are essential.

#### Will this course replace traditional software engineering courses?

+

This course complements traditional software engineering courses by focusing on modern tools and AI-assisted development. It assumes you have foundational software engineering knowledge and builds upon it with contemporary practices.

#### What is the time commitment for this course?

+

Expect approximately 10-12 hours per week including lectures, assignments, and project work. The hands-on nature of the course requires time for experimentation with new tools and technologies.

#### Are there any special software or hardware requirements?

+

Students need access to a computer capable of running modern development tools. Some cloud-based services may require subscriptions (GitHub Copilot, etc.), but the course will provide access or alternatives where possible. A reliable internet connection is essential for cloud-based tools.

#### How current will the course content be?

+

The course content is designed to be highly current, with weekly updates to reflect the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-assisted development. Guest speakers from leading companies ensure students learn about the latest industry practices and emerging tools.

#### Can I audit this course?

+

We're open to auditing requests by Stanford students and staff. You will be able to attend all the lectures, but we won't be able to grade your homework or give advice on final projects.
