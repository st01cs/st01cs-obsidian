I’ve been using CI/CD pipelines for years now - GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, you name it. Like most developers, I treated them as configuration files that “just work.” You write a YAML file, push it, and somehow your code gets built, tested, and deployed. But I never really understood what was happening behind the scenes.

That changed when I needed to set up CI/CD for an air-gapped environment at work - no access to GitHub Actions or GitLab’s hosted runners. I needed to understand how these tools actually work under the hood so I could build something custom. That’s when I realized: pipeline runners are just orchestration tools that execute jobs in isolated environments.

In this post, I’ll show you how to build a complete CI/CD pipeline runner from scratch in Python. We’ll implement the core features you use every day: stages, parallel execution, job dependencies, and artifact passing. By the end, you’ll understand exactly how GitLab Runner and GitHub Actions work internally.

## What Actually IS a CI/CD Pipeline?

Before we start coding, let’s understand what a CI/CD pipeline actually does.

A **CI/CD pipeline** is an automated workflow that takes your code from commit to deployment. It’s defined as a series of **jobs** organized into **stages**:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - python -m build

test-job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - pytest tests/

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ./deploy.sh
```

When you push code, a **pipeline runner** (like GitLab Runner or GitHub Actions) does this:

1. **Parses** the pipeline configuration file
2. **Creates a dependency graph** of jobs
3. **Executes jobs** in isolated environments (usually containers)
4. **Streams logs** back to you in real-time
5. **Passes artifacts** between jobs
6. **Reports** success or failure

The key insight: **a pipeline runner is just a job orchestrator**. It figures out what to run, in what order, and handles the execution.

Let’s build one ourselves.

## Understanding Pipeline Components

Every pipeline has three main components:

### 1\. Stages

Stages define the execution order. Jobs in the same stage can run in parallel, but stages run sequentially:

```yaml
Stage 1: build     → Stage 2: test        → Stage 3: deploy
  [build-app]        [unit-test]             [deploy-prod]
                     [integration-test]
```

### 2\. Jobs

Jobs are the actual work units. Each job:

- Runs in an isolated environment (container)
- Executes a series of shell commands
- Can depend on other jobs
- Can produce artifacts for other jobs

### 3\. Artifacts

Artifacts are files produced by one job that other jobs need. For example:

- Build job produces `dist/` folder
- Test jobs need `dist/` to run tests
- Deploy job needs `dist/` to deploy

Now that we understand the concepts, let’s start building.

## Building Our Pipeline Runner

### Version 1: Single Job Executor

Let’s start with the absolute basics - executing a single job in a Docker container:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Pipeline Runner v1: Single job executor
Executes one job in a Docker container and streams logs
"""

import yaml
import subprocess
import sys
from pathlib import Path

class Job:
    """Represents a single pipeline job."""

    def __init__(self, name, config):
        self.name = name
        self.image = config.get('image', 'python:3.11')
        self.script = config.get('script', [])
        self.stage = config.get('stage', 'test')

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Job({self.name}, stage={self.stage})"

class JobExecutor:
    """Executes a job in a Docker container."""

    def __init__(self, workspace):
        self.workspace = Path(workspace).resolve()

    def run(self, job):
        """Execute a job and stream output."""
        print(f"\n{'='*60}")
        print(f"[{job.name}] Starting job...")
        print(f"[{job.name}] Image: {job.image}")
        print(f"[{job.name}] Stage: {job.stage}")
        print(f"{'='*60}\n")

        # Combine all script commands into one shell command
        script = ' && '.join(job.script)

        # Build docker run command
        cmd = [
            'docker', 'run',
            '--rm',  # Remove container after execution
            '-v', f'{self.workspace}:/workspace',  # Mount workspace
            '-w', '/workspace',  # Set working directory
            job.image,
            'sh', '-c', script
        ]

        try:
            # Run and stream output in real-time
            process = subprocess.Popen(
                cmd,
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
                text=True,
                bufsize=1
            )

            # Stream output line by line
            for line in process.stdout:
                print(f"[{job.name}] {line}", end='')

            process.wait()

            if process.returncode == 0:
                print(f"\n[{job.name}] ✓ Job completed successfully\n")
                return True
            else:
                print(f"\n[{job.name}] ✗ Job failed with exit code {process.returncode}\n")
                return False

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"\n[{job.name}] ✗ Error: {e}\n")
            return False

class Pipeline:
    """Represents a pipeline with jobs."""

    def __init__(self, config_file):
        self.config_file = Path(config_file)
        self.config = self._load_config()
        self.jobs = self._parse_jobs()

    def _load_config(self):
        """Load and parse YAML configuration."""
        with open(self.config_file) as f:
            return yaml.safe_load(f)

    def _parse_jobs(self):
        """Parse jobs from configuration."""
        jobs = []
        for job_name, job_config in self.config.items():
            if job_name != 'stages' and isinstance(job_config, dict):
                jobs.append(Job(job_name, job_config))
        return jobs

    def run(self, workspace='.'):
        """Execute all jobs sequentially."""
        print(f"\nStarting pipeline from {self.config_file}")
        print(f"Found {len(self.jobs)} job(s)\n")

        executor = JobExecutor(workspace)

        for job in self.jobs:
            success = executor.run(job)
            if not success:
                print("Pipeline failed!")
                return False

        print("✓ Pipeline completed successfully!")
        return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python runner_v1.py <pipeline.yml>")
        sys.exit(1)

    pipeline = Pipeline(sys.argv[1])
    success = pipeline.run()
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```

#### Testing Version 1

Create a simple pipeline config:

```yaml
# pipeline.yml
build-job:
  image: python:3.11
  script:
    - echo "Building application..."
    - python --version
    - pip install --quiet build
    - echo "Build complete!"
```

Run it:

```bash
python runner_v1.py pipeline.yml
```

You should see output like:

```yaml
Starting pipeline from pipeline.yml
Found 1 job(s)

============================================================
[build-job] Starting job...
[build-job] Image: python:3.11
[build-job] Stage: test
============================================================

[build-job] Building application...
[build-job] Python 3.11.9
[build-job] Build complete!

[build-job] ✓ Job completed successfully

✓ Pipeline completed successfully!
```

Great! We can execute a single job. But real pipelines have multiple stages. Let’s add that.

### Version 2: Multi-Stage Pipeline with Sequential Execution

Now let’s add support for stages. Jobs in different stages should run in order:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Pipeline Runner v2: Multi-stage support

"""

import yaml
import subprocess

        self.script = config.get('script', [])
        self.stage = config.get('stage', 'test')

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Job({self.name}, stage={self.stage})"

class JobExecutor:
    """Executes a job in a Docker container."""

    def __init__(self, workspace):
        self.workspace = Path(workspace).resolve()

    def run(self, job):
        """Execute a job and stream output."""
        print(f"[{job.name}] Starting job...")

        script = ' && '.join(job.script)

        cmd = [
            'docker', 'run', '--rm',
            '-v', f'{self.workspace}:/workspace',
            '-w', '/workspace',
            job.image,

        ]

        try:

                cmd,
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
                text=True,
                bufsize=1
            )

            for line in process.stdout:
                print(f"[{job.name}] {line}", end='')

            process.wait()

            if process.returncode == 0:
                print(f"[{job.name}] ✓ Job completed successfully")
                return True
            else:
                print(f"[{job.name}] ✗ Job failed with exit code {process.returncode}")
                return False

        except Exception as e:

class Pipeline:

    def __init__(self, config_file):

        return stages

    def run(self, workspace='.'):

        print(f"\n{'='*60}")
        print(f"Starting pipeline: {self.config_file.name}")
        print(f"Stages: {' → '.join(self.stages)}")
        print(f"Total jobs: {len(self.jobs)}")
        print(f"{'='*60}\n")

        executor = JobExecutor(workspace)
        stages_with_jobs = self._group_jobs_by_stage()

            if not stage_jobs:
                continue

            print(f"\n{'─'*60}")
            print(f"Stage: {stage} ({len(stage_jobs)} job(s))")
            print(f"{'─'*60}\n")

            # Execute all jobs in this stage (sequentially for now)
            for job in stage_jobs:
                success = executor.run(job)
                if not success:
                    print(f"\n✗ Pipeline failed at stage '{stage}'")
                    return False

        print(f"\n{'='*60}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: python runner_v2.py <pipeline.yml>")
        sys.exit(1)

    pipeline = Pipeline(sys.argv[1])
    success = pipeline.run()
    sys.exit(0 if success else 1)
```

#### Testing Version 2

Create a multi-stage pipeline:

```yaml
# pipeline.yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.11
  script:
    - echo "Building application..."
    - mkdir -p dist
    - echo "v1.0.0" > dist/version.txt

test-job:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.11
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
    - python -c "print('All tests passed!')"

deploy-job:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - cat dist/version.txt
    - echo "Deployment complete!"
```

Run it:

```bash
python runner_v2.py pipeline.yml
```

Now we have stages! But notice that if you have multiple jobs in the test stage, they still run sequentially. In real CI/CD, jobs in the same stage run in parallel. Let’s add that.

### Version 3: Parallel Job Execution

Real pipeline runners execute jobs in the same stage in parallel. Let’s implement this using Python’s `multiprocessing`:

#### Testing Version 3

Create a pipeline with parallel jobs:

```yaml
# pipeline.yml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build-job:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.11
  script:
    - echo "Building..."
    - sleep 2

unit-tests:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.11
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests..."
    - sleep 3
    - echo "Unit tests passed!"

integration-tests:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.11
  script:
    - echo "Running integration tests..."
    - sleep 3
    - echo "Integration tests passed!"
```

Run it and notice that `unit-tests` and `integration-tests` run simultaneously!

Now we have parallel execution, but there’s a problem: what if `test` jobs need artifacts from the `build` job? We need dependency management and artifact passing.

### Version 4: Dependencies and Artifacts

This is where it gets interesting. We need to:

1. Build a dependency graph (which jobs need which other jobs)
2. Execute jobs in topological order (respecting dependencies)
3. Pass artifacts between jobs

#### Testing Version 4

Create a pipeline with dependencies and artifacts:

```yaml
# pipeline.yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-app:
  stage: build
  image: python:3.11
  script:
    - echo "Building application..."
    - mkdir -p dist
    - echo "app-v1.0.0" > dist/app.txt
    - echo "Build complete!"
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

unit-tests:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.11
  needs:
    - build-app
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests..."
    - ls -la dist/
    - cat dist/app.txt
    - echo "Tests passed!"

integration-tests:
  stage: test
  image: python:3.11
  needs:
    - build-app
  script:
    - echo "Running integration tests..."
    - cat dist/app.txt
    - echo "Integration tests passed!"

deploy-prod:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  needs:
    - unit-tests
    - integration-tests
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production..."
    - cat dist/app.txt
    - echo "Deployed!"
```

Run it:

```bash
python runner_v4.py pipeline.yml
```

Notice how:

- `build-app` runs first
- `unit-tests` and `integration-tests` run in parallel (both depend on `build-app`)
- `deploy-prod` runs only after both test jobs complete
- Artifacts (the `dist/` folder) are passed between jobs!

This is getting close to a real CI/CD runner. Let’s add one more version with production-ready features.

#### Testing Version 5

Create a complete pipeline with all features:

```yaml
# pipeline.yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  APP_VERSION: "1.0.0"
  PYTHON_IMAGE: "python:3.11"

build-app:
  stage: build
  image: ${PYTHON_IMAGE}
  script:
    - echo "Building version ${APP_VERSION}..."
    - mkdir -p dist
    - echo "app-${APP_VERSION}" > dist/app.txt
    - echo "Build complete!"
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

unit-tests:
  stage: test
  image: ${PYTHON_IMAGE}
  needs:
    - build-app
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests..."
    - cat dist/app.txt
    - sleep 2
    - echo "Unit tests passed!"

integration-tests:
  stage: test
  image: ${PYTHON_IMAGE}
  needs:
    - build-app
  script:
    - echo "Running integration tests..."
    - cat dist/app.txt
    - sleep 2
    - echo "Integration tests passed!"

deploy-staging:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  needs:
    - unit-tests
    - integration-tests
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to staging..."
    - cat dist/app.txt
    - echo "Deployed to staging!"

deploy-production:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  needs:
    - unit-tests
    - integration-tests
  only:
    - main
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production..."
    - cat dist/app.txt
    - echo "Deployed to production!"
```

Run it:

```bash
python runner.py pipeline.yml
```

You’ll see:

- Variable substitution (`${APP_VERSION}`, `${PYTHON_IMAGE}`)
- Dependency-based execution order
- Parallel test execution
- Branch filtering (deploy-production only on main)
- Execution time tracking
- Proper artifact passing

**We now have a fully functional CI/CD pipeline runner!**

## Testing Your Pipeline Runner

Let’s test it with a real Python project. Create this structure:

```yaml
my-project/
├── pipeline.yml
├── src/
│   └── calculator.py
└── tests/
    └── test_calculator.py
```

**src/calculator.py:**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
```

**tests/test\_calculator.py:**

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, 'src')

from calculator import add, multiply

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(3, 4) == 12
    assert multiply(0, 5) == 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_add()
    test_multiply()
    print("All tests passed!")
```

**pipeline.yml:**

```yaml
stages:
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11"

lint-code:
  stage: test
  image: python:${PYTHON_VERSION}
  script:
    - echo "Linting code..."
    - python -m py_compile src/*.py
    - echo "Lint passed!"

unit-tests:
  stage: test
  image: python:${PYTHON_VERSION}
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests..."
    - python tests/test_calculator.py
    - echo "Tests passed!"

build-package:
  stage: build
  image: python:${PYTHON_VERSION}
  needs:
    - lint-code
    - unit-tests
  script:
    - echo "Building package..."
    - mkdir -p dist
    - cp -r src dist/
    - echo "v1.0.0" > dist/VERSION
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

deploy-app:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  needs:
    - build-package
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - ls -la dist/
    - cat dist/VERSION
    - echo "Deployment complete!"
```

Run your pipeline:

```bash
python runner.py pipeline.yml
```

You’ll see:

1. `lint-code` and `unit-tests` run in parallel
2. `build-package` waits for both to complete
3. Artifacts (dist/) are passed to `deploy-app`
4. Total execution time is optimized through parallelization

## What We Built vs. What Production Runners Do

Our pipeline runner demonstrates the core concepts, but production tools like GitLab Runner and GitHub Actions have many more features:

**What we built:**

- ✅ Multi-stage pipelines
- ✅ Parallel job execution within stages
- ✅ Job dependencies (needs/dependencies)
- ✅ Artifact passing between jobs
- ✅ Variable substitution
- ✅ Branch filtering (only: branches)
- ✅ Job timeouts
- ✅ Real-time log streaming
- ✅ Topological sorting for dependencies
- ✅ Docker container isolation

**What production runners add:**

- **Distributed execution**: Run jobs across multiple machines
- **Caching**: Cache dependencies (node\_modules, pip packages) between runs
- **Matrix builds**: Run same job with different parameters (Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- **Webhooks**: Trigger on git push, PR, tag events
- **Secrets management**: Secure credential storage and injection
- **Web UI**: Visual pipeline visualization and logs
- **Docker-in-Docker**: Build Docker images within jobs
- **Service containers**: Database/Redis for integration tests
- **Retry mechanisms**: Automatic retry on transient failures
- **Manual triggers**: Approval gates for deployments
- **Resource management**: CPU/memory limits per job
- **Security features**: Isolation, sandboxing, permission control

## Understanding the Architecture

Our runner has four main components:

### 1\. Configuration Parser

Reads YAML and builds job objects with all metadata (stage, dependencies, artifacts, etc.)

### 2\. Dependency Resolver

Uses topological sorting to determine execution order. This ensures jobs run only after their dependencies complete.

### 3\. Job Scheduler

Groups jobs into batches that can run in parallel. Uses Python’s multiprocessing for parallel execution.

### 4\. Job Executor

Spawns Docker containers, mounts workspace, executes scripts, streams logs, and manages artifacts.

The flow:

```yaml
YAML Config → Parse Jobs → Build Dependency Graph →
Topological Sort → Execute Batches → Save Artifacts → Report Results
```

## Real-World Use Cases

You could actually use this runner for:

1. **Local CI/CD testing**: Test your pipeline config before pushing
2. **Air-gapped environments**: No external CI/CD access
3. **Custom workflows**: Company-specific requirements
4. **Learning tool**: Understand how CI/CD works internally
5. **Embedded systems**: Limited connectivity to cloud runners
6. **On-premise deployments**: Full control over execution environment

## Performance Considerations

Our runner is reasonably efficient, but here’s what impacts performance:

**What makes it fast:**

- Parallel execution within stages
- Dependency-aware scheduling (no unnecessary waiting)
- Docker container reuse
- Minimal artifact copying

**What could slow it down:**

- Docker image pulls (first time)
- Large artifacts being copied
- Many jobs in sequence (long critical path)
- Heavy multiprocessing overhead for tiny jobs

**Optimizations you could add:**

- Cache Docker images
- Compress artifacts
- Parallel artifact downloads
- Job scheduling across machines

## Extending the Runner

Here are features you could add:

### 1\. Caching

```yaml
build:
  cache:
    key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF}
    paths:
      - node_modules/
```

### 2\. Matrix Builds

```yaml
test:
  image: python:${VERSION}
  matrix:
    VERSION: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]
```

### 3\. Service Containers

```yaml
integration-test:
  services:
    - postgres:13
    - redis:6
```

### 4\. Manual Triggers

```yaml
deploy:
  when: manual  # Require manual approval
```

### 5\. Retry Logic

```yaml
flaky-test:
  retry: 2  # Retry up to 2 times
```

## Conclusion

By building this CI/CD pipeline runner, we’ve demystified how GitLab Runner and GitHub Actions work internally. The core concepts aren’t that complicated:

- **Parse configuration** into job objects
- **Build a dependency graph** to understand execution order
- **Use topological sorting** to schedule jobs correctly
- **Execute jobs in containers** for isolation
- **Pass artifacts** between dependent jobs
- **Stream logs** for visibility

GitLab’s innovation wasn’t inventing these concepts - it was packaging them into a developer-friendly tool with great UX, distributed execution, and enterprise features.

Understanding these fundamentals makes you a better DevOps engineer. When pipelines are slow, you’ll know why. When jobs fail mysteriously, you’ll know where to look. When you need custom CI/CD, you’ll know how to build it.

## Further Learning

If you want to dive deeper:

- **GitLab Runner source code**: Written in Go, shows production implementation
- **GitHub Actions runner**: Open source, similar concepts
- **Tekton**: Kubernetes-native pipelines
- **Drone CI**: Simple, container-focused CI/CD
- **Argo Workflows**: DAG-based workflow engine for Kubernetes

I also recommend reading about:

- **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**: Foundation of job dependencies
- **Topological sorting**: Algorithm for dependency resolution
- **Container orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm
- **Workflow engines**: Apache Airflow, Prefect

Want to take this further? Here are some ideas:

1. **Add a web UI**: Use Flask + WebSockets for real-time pipeline visualization
2. **Implement caching**: Cache pip/npm packages between runs
3. **Add distributed execution**: Run jobs across multiple machines
4. **Build a webhook server**: Trigger on git push events
5. **Create a VS Code extension**: Visualize pipelines in your editor
